# Data Science Portfolio
This repository consist of end to end projects on data science completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. Following steps are followed for completing the projects and they are:
- Defining Problem Statement
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 
- Treating Outliers
- Data Pre-processing
- Building Machine Learning Algorithms 
- Conclusion
Various Machine learning models and python libraries are used such as:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit learn
