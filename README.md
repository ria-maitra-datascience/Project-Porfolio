# Data Science Portfolio
This repository consist of end to end projects on data science completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. Following steps are followed for completing the projects and they are:
#### 1. Defining Problem Statement
#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 
#### 3. Treating Outliers
#### 4. Data Pre-processing
#### 5. Building Machine Learning Algorithms 
#### 6. Conclusion
